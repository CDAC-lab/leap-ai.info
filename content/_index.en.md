## La Trobe Energy Analytics Platform (LEAP)

### What is LEAP?
LEAP (La Trobe Energy Analytics Platform) is the flagship Artificial Intelligence initiative of La Trobe University’s Net Zero by 2029 Program. LEAP harnesses the power of AI to process a billion data points, generating a thousand actionable insights conveyed through a net zero chatbot, designed to aid human decision-making in energy management.

Key Features of LEAP:

- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: LEAP tracks energy consumption patterns and building performance for up to 50 buildings across La Trobe’s campuses. This includes real-time monitoring of lighting, heating, and cooling systems to optimize energy use.

- **AI and Machine Learning**: The platform employs AI and machine learning algorithms to predict solar energy generation, detect anomalies in energy usage, and forecast future energy consumption. This predictive capability helps in making proactive adjustments to reduce energy waste.

- **Actionable Insights**: By processing a billion data points, LEAP generates a thousand actionable insights, which are conveyed through a net zero chatbot. These insights help facility managers and decision-makers optimize building management systems (BMS) and implement energy-saving measures in real time.

- **Sustainability Goals**: LEAP supports La Trobe’s commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2029. The platform plays a crucial role in reducing the university’s carbon footprint by improving energy efficiency and resource utilization. For example, the platform aids in managing renewable energy sources like solar PV systems, which are integral to La Trobe's sustainability strategy.

- **Collaboration and Innovation**: Developed in collaboration with the Centre for Data Analytics and Cognition (CDAC) at La Trobe, LEAP embodies the university's innovative approach to tackling environmental challenges. The platform has been recognized for its excellence with awards such as the 2021 Clever Campus Innovation Award by TEFMA and the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Human System Interaction Conference 2022 for the Net Zero Emissions Track.

- **Educational and Research Benefits**: LEAP serves as a living lab for students and researchers, providing a real-world environment to study and innovate in energy management. The platform also facilitates hands-on learning and research opportunities, enhancing the educational experience at La Trobe University.

### LEAP’s Achievements
- 2021 Clever Campus Innovation Award: Recognized by the Tertiary Education Facilities Management Association (TEFMA) for its innovative approach to campus energy management.
- Best Paper Award: Awarded at the IEEE Human System Interaction Conference 2022 for the Net Zero Emissions Track, acknowledging LEAP's conceptual excellence.

## What is La Trobe's Net Zero Emissions Goal?
La Trobe University aims to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2029, becoming the first Victorian university to reach this milestone. The ambitious program covers:

- **Campus Coverage**: 267 hectares (660 acres) across 5 campuses, encompassing over 100 buildings and spaces.
- **Large Scale Projects**: 20 significant projects across the university focusing on:
- **Renewable Energy Expansion**: Installation of Solar PV systems with 2.5Mw capacity in Bundoora and 1.1Mw in regional campuses.
- **Electrical Infrastructure Overhaul**: Including extensive LED lighting upgrades.
- **Operational Optimization**: Enhancing Building Management Systems (BMS) for better energy efficiency.
- **Building Electrification**: Transitioning buildings to be fully electric.
- **Waste Reduction**: Implementing organic recycling programs.
- **Green Star Buildings**: Including the Sports Stadium, which boasts a 6 Green Star rating.

La Trobe University has already achieved significant milestones on its journey to net zero, including achieving net zero emissions status for its regional campuses by 2022. The university has installed around 7,500 solar panels at its Bundoora campus, generating 2.5 MW of renewable energy. Additionally, a new solar farm at Bundoora, set to be the largest urban solar farm in Victoria, will further boost the university's renewable energy capacity​ (Home)​​ (Mirage News)​​ (Sustainability Matters Australia)​​ (pv magazine Australia)​.
