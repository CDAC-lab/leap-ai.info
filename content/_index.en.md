## La Trobe Energy AI Platform (LEAP)

### What is LEAP?
LEAP (La Trobe Energy AI Platform) is La Trobe University’s flagship AI project for achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2029. LEAP harnesses the power of Predictive, Explainable and Causal AI to process a billion data points, generating a thousand actionable insights that interface through a Generative AI chatbot for informed human decision-making in effective energy management.

Key Features of LEAP:

- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: LEAP tracks energy consumption patterns and building performance for up to 50 buildings across La Trobe’s campuses. This includes real-time monitoring of lighting, heating, and cooling systems to optimize energy use.

- **AI and Machine Learning**: The platform employs AI and machine learning algorithms to predict solar energy generation, detect anomalies in energy usage, and forecast future energy consumption. This predictive capability helps in making proactive adjustments to reduce energy waste.

- **Actionable Insights**: By processing a billion data points, LEAP generates a thousand actionable insights, which are conveyed through a net zero chatbot. These insights help facility managers and decision-makers optimize building management systems (BMS) and implement energy-saving measures in real time.

- **Sustainability Goals**: LEAP supports La Trobe’s commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2029. The platform plays a crucial role in reducing the university’s carbon footprint by improving energy efficiency and resource utilization. For example, the platform aids in managing renewable energy sources like solar PV systems, which are integral to La Trobe's sustainability strategy.

- **Collaboration and Innovation**: Developed in collaboration with the Centre for Data Analytics and Cognition (CDAC) at La Trobe, LEAP embodies the university's innovative approach to tackling environmental challenges. The platform has been recognized for its excellence with awards such as the 2021 Clever Campus Innovation Award by TEFMA and the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Human System Interaction Conference 2022 for the Net Zero Emissions Track.

- **Learning and Research Enabler**: LEAP serves as a living lab for students and researchers, providing a real-world environment to study and innovate in energy management. The platform also facilitates hands-on learning and research opportunities, enhancing the educational experience at La Trobe University.
