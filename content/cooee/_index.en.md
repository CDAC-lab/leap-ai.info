## What is Cooee?

**Cooee** is LEAP's cognitive conversational agent — an intelligence layer that understands energy data, user context, and intent.

It allows users to ask natural questions like  
> *"Why did Building MH1 spike by 7.5% last week?"*  

and receive analytical, context-rich explanations grounded in LEAP's live datasets.

Energy analytics dashboards are powerful, but interpreting data still requires time, expertise, and switching between multiple tools. **Cooee** bridges this gap by transforming dashboards into intelligent conversational experiences — combining human reasoning with automated analysis.

### Key Capabilities
- Natural language querying of energy dashboards  
- Real-time contextual reasoning  
- Adaptive memory and personalization  
- Seamless integration within the LEAP web interface

### How Cooee Works

Cooee follows a five-stage reasoning pipeline:

1. **Understand** — Interprets user intent in context (domain, role, site, etc.)  
2. **Retrieve** — Gathers relevant data from LEAP sources and APIs  
3. **Reason** — Analyzes cause–effect relationships and performance trends  
4. **Respond** — Generates concise, human-readable insights  
5. **Remember** — Stores short-term and long-term context for personalization

## Conversational Intelligence for Sustainable Energy Management

> *La Trobe University's AI-powered energy analytics platform that transforms complex sustainability data into intuitive, conversational insights.*

**Cooee** (Conversational Intelligence for Energy Efficiency) is La Trobe University's flagship AI research project within the **LEAP Energy Analytics Platform** — an innovative system that enables natural language interaction with complex energy and sustainability data.

Developed by our research team, Cooee transforms traditional energy dashboards into intelligent conversational experiences, allowing users to explore sustainability metrics through natural dialogue rather than navigating complex interfaces.

### Real-World Applications

Users can ask intuitive questions such as:
> *"What caused the energy spike in the Library Building last month?"*  
> *"How has our carbon footprint changed over the past year?"*  
> *"Which buildings are performing best for energy efficiency?"*

Cooee provides contextual, data-driven responses that combine real-time analytics with historical insights, making sustainability data accessible to students, staff, and researchers across the university.
