# About LEAP
LEAP (La Trobe Energy AI Platform) is La Trobe University's flagship AI project for achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2029. The project is designed, developed, and deployed as a “Living AI Lab” by the Centre for Data Analytics and Cognition (CDAC), La Trobe’s leading research centre for fundamental and applied AI research.

## Awards and Recognition

- 2021 Clever Campus Innovation Award: Recognized by the Tertiary Education Facilities Management Association (TEFMA) for its innovative approach to campus energy management.
- Best Paper Award: Awarded at the IEEE Human System Interaction Conference 2022 for the Net Zero Emissions Track, acknowledging LEAP's conceptual excellence.

## Project Leadership and Team:

- Project Sponsor: Andrew Jennings
- Project Lead: Prof Daswin De Silva
- Technical Architect: Dr Nishan Mills
- Team Members: The CDAC team building LEAP consists of eight full-time PhD candidates.
- Ethics Oversight: The CDAC Ethics committee provides complete ethical, governance, and compliance oversight and advice at each stage of LEAP development and deployment.

## Technological Innovations:

- All-Data Lakehouse: Generates a single-version-of-truth, centralized repository of internal data streams on consumption, generation, utilization, events, and external data streams of weather, climate, tariff, and energy market metrics.
- Data Quality Framework: Validates all data feeds to standards and formats, ensuring the all-data lakehouse is inclusive and complete.
- AI and Automation Engine: Consists of multiple intelligent and automated functions, including baseline prediction, short-term and long-term consumption and generation forecasting, anomaly detection, tariff simulation, and bill validation.
- Multi-Stakeholder Analytics Dashboards: Visualize energy metrics, forecasts, fluctuations, trends, and outliers that can be analyzed by various stakeholders, such as users, operators, managers, providers, and advocacy groups.

## International Collaborations:

LEAP has enabled international research collaborations with Lulea University of Technology, Sweden, and Aalto University, Finland. These collaborations focus on spatiotemporal AI for energy market price dynamics and adaptive multi-energy virtual power plants for complex buildings.

## Community Engagement

LEAP is shared with the local community, including schools and community centers. It serves as a change agent, bringing together local schools and residents through public events like hackathons and seminars. Feedback and lessons learned are dispersed to the public to further emissions reduction and operational efficiency.

# La Trobe's Net Zero Emissions Goal
La Trobe University aims to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2029, becoming the first Victorian University to reach this milestone. The program covers:

- **Campus Coverage**: 267 hectares (660 acres) across 5 campuses, encompassing over 100 buildings and spaces.
- **Large Scale Projects**: 20 significant projects across the university focusing on:
- **Renewable Energy Expansion**: Installation of Solar PV systems with 2.5Mw capacity in Bundoora and 1.1Mw in regional campuses.
- **Electrical Infrastructure Overhaul**: Including extensive LED lighting upgrades.
- **Operational Optimization**: Enhancing Building Management Systems (BMS) for better energy efficiency.
- **Building Electrification**: Transitioning buildings to be fully electric.
- **Waste Reduction**: Implementing organic recycling programs.
- **Green Star Buildings**: Including the Sports Stadium, which boasts a 6 Green Star rating.

La Trobe University has already achieved significant milestones on its journey to net zero, including achieving net zero emissions status for its regional campuses by 2022. The university has installed around 7,500 solar panels at its Bundoora campus, generating 2.5 MW of renewable energy. Additionally, a new solar farm at Bundoora, set to be the largest urban solar farm in Victoria, will further boost the university's renewable energy capacity​​.
